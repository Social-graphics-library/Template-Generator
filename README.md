A tool based on Electron to generate JavaScript / TypeScript template classes for the social graphics library from SVG files.

---

## Installation

With each release we make a build of the tool available for download as a ZIP.
After downloading and unpacking the tool, all you have to do to start it is run the ```sgl-template-generator.exe```.
Alternatively, you can of course build the tool yourself.

A Node + NPM installation is necessary for this.

After cloning or downloading the project, all you have to do is run ```npm run deploy``` in the project folder.

The build script first installs all dependencies with ```npm install``` and then builds the executable in the following folder:

```./tmp/build/electron/sgl-template-generator-win32-x64/```
